# Robinhood Auto Trader
Automatically buys and sells stocks, using the `robin_stocks` library. Also includes a local web interface to allow for parameter tuning and monitoring.

# Quick Start
- Set up a virtual environment using `requirements.txt`
- Make a `.env` file by copying/renaming `default.env`, and enter your login information
- Run the dashboard with `flask --app flask_app run`
- Open the site and tune the algorithm as you see fit
- Schedule `execute_trades.py` to execute daily, either manually or automatically.
> Tip: You can use the `--auto` argument when running `execute_trades.py` to bypass confirmation messages for any order.
